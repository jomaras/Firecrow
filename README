Firecrow - tool for extracting code from client-side web applications

Prerequisites:
 - Firefox 27
 - Install the Firecrow plugin (zip the content of the repository, rename the extension to .xpi and drag drop to Firefox)
 - Video tutorial on how to install and use Firecrow: http://marjan.fesb.hr/~jomaras/demo/InstallAndUseFirecrow/InstallAndUseFirecrow.html
 - Plase, have in mind that Firecrow is a research prototype

Usage:

 - Can be run with phantom js and nodejs (see Firecrow/phantomJs/ and Firecrow/nodejs folders)
