Ideas:
 - Besides looking at code-coverage when selecting the next scenario for execution, also study the probability of the event-sequence occurrence
 - heuristics that takes into account how long the user takes to do something

ToDo:
 - fix to work on Artemis examples
 - enable data gathering for different prioritization functions (FIFO, random, random with weights, heuristics)
 - test on a larger number of web applications with different libraries, that have different behaviors
