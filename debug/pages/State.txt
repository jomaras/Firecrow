fancyCheckbox - two test cases, both work
humanTypist - works
idt - works
tabs - works
jsRGBPassword - works (maybe i also add with below 4 passwords)
tinySlider - works 4 cases (only arrows, only thumbnails, auto, all together)
codeBubbl
validate.js - needs some work on it, not sure how to test it, maybe make a number of different web pages
              where each tests only a subset of rules; the problem is recording the case - onsubmit redirects
              to another page - maybe rework the case so that in all cases it returns false, just says everything
              ok

idubitablee - on prototype (probably nothing out of it)
jQueryCarousel - passes tests, but makes heavy modifications of the UI - so something gets lost
line25AnimatedMenu - uses an old jQuery version, not sure if i want to get into it
line25JQuerySlideshow - something is heavily screwed up

proposable - not yet tested
sketchdock - not yet tested; but is on prototype

Zebra Accordion - not yet tested

tinySlider - uses new Function!; and add support for onclick directly in html
