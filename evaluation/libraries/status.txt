    - Assertions failed in file: C:\GitWebStorm\Firecrow\evaluation\libraries\jQuery\slicedAll\core21map.html ( delete result[ label ]; not included in map callback)
      The reason for this boils down to this:

      var obj = {arr: [1,2]};
      var a1 = 0;

      obj.arr.map(function(i)
      {
          if(obj.arr)
          {
              delete obj.arr;
              a1 += i;
          }
      });

      a1;

      The problem is, if this was realized with two normal call expressions towards the callback method,
      then the second call expression would not be included; but here, via map it is. The conclusion is
      that - for callback functions the control flow through the callback function has to be preserved.

    - data05dataOnElement fails (isEmptyObject not included for some reason :-/, now fixed with by adding an assertEquals to the testCode that calls isEmptyObject)
