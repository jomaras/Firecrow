    - manipulation 06, problem in jquery selector $("#yahoo, #first") in function Sizzle
      this should be taken care of with document.querySelectorAll() and returned, but
      for some reason the return is not included; and return should not be included
      for its data, but for the control flow - somehow it is ignored in the while loop
      (so when it is not included, an infinite loop occurs)


      - the problem is in:

      ASTHelper.isReturnStatement(codeConstruct)
                      && !mapping.isCallbackReturn && !this.inclusionFinder.isIncludedElement(codeConstruct)

                      in the dependency graph - this last expression should not be included
