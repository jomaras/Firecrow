    - Assertions failed in file: C:\GitWebStorm\Firecrow\evaluation\libraries\jQuery\slicedAll\core18each.html (return false in each callback with Array(4) not included)
    - Assertions failed in file: C:\GitWebStorm\Firecrow\evaluation\libraries\jQuery\slicedAll\core21map.html ( delete result[ label ]; not included in map callback)
    - data05dataOnElement fails (isEmptyObject not included for some reason :-/, now fixed with by adding an assertEquals to the testCode that calls isEmptyObject)
