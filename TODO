- Make it work for other pages!!
   - problem with

        - there is an overall problem of dependencyPostprocessor - that part should not be there
        - return Sizzle(expr, null, null, [node]).length in Sizzle.matchesSelector (return from Sizzle is not included); but it does not seem that Sizzle(expr, null).. is even necessary
        + the problem is that [node] is necessary -> this probably causes the inclusion of everything in the call expressions
        ! -> (but the problem is including the property .length in the dependency postprocessor)
        -

   + problem with thisCache[jQuery.camelCase(name)];
        (there is no connection to thisCache and jQuery.camelCase is "imporant") - study more!
   - the problem was with creating dependencies between internal function call expressions and arguments (arg -> call expression, i don't know why i even did that..)

- dependency traversal algorithm in node.js
    - for finding groups, maybe don't go through all dependencies again, but only forward till it is ok, and backward till it is ok

- Make automatic testing for libraries
    - gauss
    - medialize (has errors - fix)
        - Guide: run C:\GitWebStorm\Firecrow\tests\libraries\medialize\tests\debugMedialize.html (and study errors)
        - it seems that i broke something when i added automatic toValue and toString invocation (check it by creating a smaller test suite behaving the same way)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Testing TO-DO list:
- Test 35 - array problems
- Test 53 - includes return where not necessary

- make a test suite for testing the interpreter, does not do slicing,
  just performs operations, and in the end compares the state of the variables
  with some predefined

- smaller, but more effective test suite
- delete all unnecessary tests
- enable all tests!
- make one unified test that tests both debugSlicing and debugDOM tests

To Do List:

- eval
- ES5 stuff (Object.defineProperty, etc.), canvas
- refactor
