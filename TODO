- Make it work for other pages!!
   - continue with why
        - $(".review > div:gt(0)") does not give the same results as in the original code
        - hide should work now, so test on the larger set of data

- problem with thisCache[jQuery.camelCase(name)]; (there is no connection to thisCache and jQuery.camelCase is "imporant") - study more!
- there are problems in the algorithm itself:
    - the problem here was that thisCache was not included; i've rewritten the code generation code to not return an empty string if the object in not included
    ! in jQuery with jQuery.camelCase, the dependency that should be followed is of higher index then the base dependency and it gets ignored
      this in turn causes the selection of another, previous dependency that should not be related (simply because it is of lower index)
- dependency traversal algorithm in node.js
    - for finding groups, maybe don't go through all dependencies again, but only forward till it is ok, and backward till it is ok

- Make automatic testing for libraries
    - gauss
    - medialize (has errors - fix)
        - Guide: run C:\GitWebStorm\Firecrow\tests\libraries\medialize\tests\debugMedialize.html (and study errors)
        - it seems that i broke something when i added automatic toValue and toString invocation (check it by creating a smaller test suite behaving the same way)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Testing TO-DO list:
- Test 35 - array problems
- Test 53 - includes return where not necessary

- make a test suite for testing the interpreter, does not do slicing,
  just performs operations, and in the end compares the state of the variables
  with some predefined

- smaller, but more effective test suite
- delete all unnecessary tests
- enable all tests!
- make one unified test that tests both debugSlicing and debugDOM tests

To Do List:

- eval
- ES5 stuff (Object.defineProperty, etc.), canvas
- refactor
